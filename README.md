This is a repository for all of my Circuit Python assignments.

# CircuitPython Servo Assignment:

Objective:
In this assignment, I had to wire up a servo to my metro express, and write code in CircuitPython to command the servo to rotate 180 degrees. 

Problems:
I had a lot of trouble with this assignment, as I haven't coded since last year, and I basically had to start from scratch. In the beginning, I had a problem where the servo would seem like it was going to work, but would just vibrate and not actually spin the top piece. I don't know If this is a problem with my code or the servo itself. I'm pretty sure my code is right, as I checked it with a repository from one of my classemates. I finally swiched something up in my code, and it allowed the servo to function normally.

Wiring: 
I don't know how to put an image into github yet, or how to access fritzing. It says I have to pay to download.


# CircuitPython Photointerrupters assignment:

Objective:
In this assignment, I had to wire up my Metro Express to my photointerrupter, and command the photointerrupter to track how many times it had been interrupted. 

Problems:
I had never wired a photointerrupter to a Metro express, so I had to use Luke Franks code as a reference point(thank you for coming in clutch Frank). I had written my code, and I was pretty sure it was right, but it still wasn't working. After a few days of being stuck, I finally figured out that my wiring was to blame. I had mixed up my negative and positive terminals on my breaboard, and after I switched them, it began to work. I  had tunnel vision on my code, and should have taken a step back to look at all of my pieces, not just the code.
